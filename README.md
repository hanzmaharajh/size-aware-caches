# LRUCache
A caching object that supports one of three caching strategies:
1. LRU
2. Size aware LRU (evictions are weighted toward larger objects)
3. Size and popularity aware LRU (evictions are weighted toward large, and less frequently used objects)

This class has only been lightly tested and minimally documented. An input/feedback will be appreciated.
